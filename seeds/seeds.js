      "I still feel sad and depressed almost a few times a week, because so much can easily remind me of her. Although I've gotten a full time job, and I've reunited with my family and friends. I still feel like my life isn't complete and I just feel sad so often. Her family was religious and she wanted me to stop some of my hobbies and just being the person I was. When I first moved in with her, everything was fine and I loved every second of it. But then started to make me change so much which is why I ended it months later. I don't know if it's because I miss her (even though of all the toxicity and controlling) or I just don't know how to be single anymore. It's annoying when people tell you to move on, but I don't find it that easy. I don't know what to do anymore",

I didn’t know this when I first arrived, so I got really excited when I saw someone wearing a jersey from my favorite team (Seattle Seahawks, American football). I shouted “GO HAWKS” pretty loud expecting and equally excited response, instead I got looks of confusion and fright from the guy and the five people he was with.I know this isn’t particularly scandalous but it’s one of those embarrassing moments that randomly pops into my head.",
