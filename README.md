# Bottlr

A social media app project built on Node.js as the runtime environment.

Bottlr uses Express for the backend to interact with the database and route all the different pages. React is used as the frontend library that allows for the creation of different webpages and the design of components within them. The database used is MongoDB, a non-SQL database with our data hosted on MongoAtlas.

The app allows for basic CRUD functionality, which functions to create and authenticate users, as well as allow them to send "bottles" either anonymously or non-anonymously. Other users can then read and upvote other people's bottles.
